# Projects

We can call **task** from here to reuse the TASK files higher up: https://taskfile.dev/usage/#running-a-taskfile-from-a-subdirectory



## Issues

https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/2159 

It cant see the .taskrc.xml or the .env higher up .

## Usage:

Each Folder is a playground.

https://github.com/blinkinglight?tab=repositories has 3 or 4 good simple examples to use as a basis.

We can then start to code gen up underneath his examples as a simple way to learn and refactor as we go.
