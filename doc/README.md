# pb-stack

https://github.com/joeblew999/pb-stack

This project came about due to the need for Developers to be Users and Users to be Developers. 

You do not have to use all the stack. Its a composition where you can pick what you want.

## Setup

### Developer 

This Project uses Task files.  See [TASK](TASK.md)

### User

Will be off the Github Pages, where binaries can be pulled.

## Terms

**Developer** is a person that works with the compilation of the code.

**Operator** is a person that works with the non compiled code with bun as the interpreter. They are utilising the binaries that the Developer built. An Operator is also a CI and CD system.

**User** is person that uses the final Software Product. They are utilising the code that the Operator build.

**Single sourcing** in data refers to using a single source of information to generate multiple outputs or documents, rather than creating separate content for each need. 


## Philosophy

**Interoperable**:  The system is designed so that the same code can be used by Developers, CI / CD ( in github ), Operators ( on cloud or on premise ), Users.

After many years building systems for large teams, you tend to start using a fair bit of code gen. Golang templates go along way in this regards.

**Heramtic**: This system extends that idea of software productivity to allow different Actors in the Software flow to run using the same system, to reduce the complexity. This is similar to the concept of "Single Sourcing", but applied deeply. 

For example, when you Package a project, the task files, binary dependencies ( for each OS and ARCH) and configuration files are put into the Package. This allows the next Actor in the Software flow to have everything they need to run the system. 

The other aspect is self sovereignty.  This means reducing your dependency on other external systems. NATS Jetstream is a huge help with this, allowing you to for example bootstrap the public SSH Keys onto any device, via a NATS Public system. Of course you do need NATS running somewhere. Another example is data sync between offline apps, which can be easily done using NATS running in a Leaf Node setup.

**GUI** Lastly, there is the GUI aspect. Web, Desktop and Mobile can all be built using simple HTMX constructs with a good quality Webview.  This applies to all Actors in the Software Flow. For example, a Developers laptop can run some tools, an Operator actor can also run some GUI to help with the process, as well as A Web GUI for end users. 


## Containerisation

Process-compose provides the ability to run a stack of binaries on any OS without docker.

Its configuration is similar to Docker Compose. 

K3, Docker, Fly, Anything can run this. 

An **Operator** will run this for an Org on A Cloud somewhere using Docker or k3.

A **User** will run locally on their own Server and their Desktop, Mobile. No Containerisation is needed.


## Stack

### Base

The basis underneath everything is:

Task provides the cross platform bootstrap.

SQLITE provides the DB. You can scale this out with Master Master copies. You can have ephemeral DB's feed off data, with the DB acting a as Materialised view.

Benthos provides a workflow system.

NATS provides a base connectivity system under everything else.

## 2nd Level

A Stack based on Pocketbase ( PB )  where:

1. Server Golang Code is generated as much as possible, so that developers are not hand writing code causing bugs and security leaks, allowing rapid extension of the system. A Fix only requires a change to the generator allowing rapid remediation.

2. Authentication and Authorisation is 100% controlled by the PB database. All in one place.

3. GUI is 100% controlled using the HTMX principles, using DataStar.  Web and Native ( Desktop and  app ) is based off the same code, using WebViews and DeepLinks to align the Web with Native. DataStar and Webviews does this.

4. Both Cloud and On Premise so that Organisations can control their own data. Cloud Flare tunnel does this.

5. Each Developer and / or User can pick a Data Center within their region for GDPR, and then choose other regions for replication. Marmot does this.


## Repo Structure

**mod** ia for modules that are reused everywhere.

**proj** is for projects built by developers that are reused by users.

**user** is for projects built by users.


Users and Developers have the exact same structure, but Users will not have the Modules, unless they are developing their own Modules of course.

So as you might have guessed this is Git OPS based, where each user has Git on their Desktop. 

- Root has the root TASK file that dictates everything else.

- MOD ( Modules ) has folders for each Stack part and a TASK file for running it.  You can make PlayGround here too to experiment and refactor.

- PROJ ( Projects ) has folders for each Project / PlayGround.  These use the Modules via the TASK files.

## Project Structure.

A Playground is a Project or Module experiment.

Each PlayGround has a TASK file, with the common TASK file manipulating these folders:

- .bin for produced binaries.
- .dep for consumed binaries.
- .pack for packing of everything for deployment.
- .src for source code.

Task files do 2 things:

- Build the binary of what they represent.
- Run the binary of what they represent. 

We can embed Task in the main binary also


## Modules

Status:  Still evolving but getting stable..

### Process Compose ( PC ) 

https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose

Provides a configuration based way to run many processes on Desktops and Servers such that:

1. Provides the ability to easily compose the system together with the parts running where needed.

2. Removes the need for K8, Docker, Docker compose, so that its simple and easy to run anywhere.

On the Cloud Servers:

- PC runs on the Host ( VPS Server ), managing the docker runtime

- PC runs inside each Docker starting up the binaries.

On the Edge / On Premise Servers:

- A Single instance of PC runs and is identical to the PC used on the Cloud Servers.

TODO: 

- Add an OS level Service runner for Desktops and Servers, so that it can be booted up by the OS easily and in a consistent way. 

### TaskFile ( TF )

https://github.com/go-task/task

Provides an alternative to Makefiles that runs on all Desktops and Servers.

Augments what PC does, allowing commands to be run. 

Has a Web GUI and Terminal GUI. 

The Web GUI reflects the commands into a Web GUI, allowing a Web based provisioning system to aid with debugging. The Web GUI is not needed once TOFU takes over and drives the provisions and configuration.

Used locally and in github actions. Single source of truth.

Can be shared across repositories using Remote Task files.


TODO:

- Build up Remote task files to control the Binaries of the Stack, so that Developers and Users have a consistent set of commands that conform to the conventions of the Stack.

### Tofu ( TOFU )

https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu

Provides a way to deploy the Stack in a consistent way to any cloud.

TOFU calls into the PC and TF sub systems to automate the provisioning and configuration of the systems.

It is idempotent, so that changes can be made and reconciled.

### Cloudflare tunnel ( CF Tunnel )

https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared

Provides a network tunnel to Cloud VPS Servers and Edge / On Premise systems, so that:

1. Systems are better protected from DDOS attacks.

2. Edge Servers and On Premise Servers are easy to expose and reduces security risks.


### Pocketbase ( PB )

https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase

Provides a SQLite DB and Web GUI Editor to allow developers to very quickly develop a database structure.

TODO: 

- Add Generator: https://github.com/Snonky/pocketbase-gogen

- Add OpenAPI: https://github.com/ogen-go/ogen/issues/1375#issuecomment-2772711703

- Structure to be like https://github.com/go-goyave/goyave 

- Extend so that the Admin settings are part of the API, so that TOFU can manage it.


### Marmot ( MA )

https://github.com/maxpert/marmot 

Example: https://github.com/maxpert/marmot-pocketbase-flyio

Provides Synchronisation of the Pocketbase DB and Files in a master / master approach. 

Marmot runs as a side car ( using PC ). 

A Global NATS Jetstream cluster is the central rendezvous point.

Features:

- Scale out - The Load balancer automatically forwards any request to the nearest Data Center.

- Network failure tolerant - The NATS Cluster will ensure any PB will catchup. 

TODO

- A PB Schema change requires a global "stop the world and sync " to be co-ordinated. Write a basic CLI to do this, which will be put into PC and later used by TOFU to make it automatic.

### DataStar ( DS )

https://github.com/starfederation/datastar

Datastar brings the functionality provided by libraries like Alpine.js (frontend reactivity) and htmx (backend reactivity) together, into one cohesive solution. Itâ€™s a lightweight, extensible framework that allows you to:

Manage state and build reactivity into your frontend using HTML attributes.

Modify the DOM and state by sending events from your backend.

With Datastar, you can build any UI that a full-stack framework like React, Vue.js or Svelte can, but with a much simpler, hypermedia-driven approach.


It reached API stability on 1st April, 2024: https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.11

Tests: https://data-star.dev/tests

Bundler: https://data-star.dev/bundler

Examples: https://data-star.dev/examples


NATS Jetstream ( and the NATS CLI ) can make calls into it, allowing many PB systems to be easily composed together globally.

## Code generation

Task files to drive the code generators as linear steps.

Development:

Its important to understand that this will be an iterative process where as we go through this we will go back and refactor these generators.

We can refactor without fear off causing refactor pain for our Developer users, because Code generation allows us to update our developers code, saving painful refactoring cycles. 

### STEP 1

Generate the golang code off the PB system.

https://github.com/Snonky/pocketbase-gogen

### STEP 2 - Open API M2M

Generate the Open API, so that the system can be used for M2M use cases.

TODO

- Use https://github.com/ogen-go/example/tree/main as a reference. It has many examples which gives me confidence that this is the right system to use.

- Write a generator that creates the Open API file off the PB Schema.

We do not know yet how far we can take this ... Lets find out.

### STEP 3 - Open API DATASTAR

Generate an OpenAPI that incorporates SSE, so that is can be used with DS.

TODO:

1. Use https://github.com/ogen-go/ogen/issues/1375#issuecomment-2766653824 as a reference as it shows the that Open API can works with SSE. 


### STEP 4 - DATASTAR WEB GUI

We might then want to add code generation of the standard things like:

- View a Table:  https://data-star.dev/examples/infinite_scroll

- Edit a Row in a Table: https://data-star.dev/examples/click_to_edit

- Delete a row in a table: https://data-star.dev/examples/bulk_update
