# mod

Each Folder is a Module.

Each Module has a TASK file to work with the module.
YOu can mix and match modules with other modules and projects by just importing the task.

Each Module has sub folders that are Playgrounds, so we can get a feel for things and work up the architecture and patterns. Its the only way to quickly work, learn and then refactor.

Each Module will have a TOFU file that is appropriate for that Module. This is typically something that is a Service Module where it will need to be configured using Tofu.
