# NATS Jetstream   

TODO:

- TASK files for all.
- https://github.com/synadia-io/nex/blob/main/Taskfile.yaml
- TOFO files for Deploying Server, Cluster and Marmot.


## Server

https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/releases/tag/v2.11.0

## Cli

https://github.com/nats-io/natscli/releases/tag/v0.2.0


## Cluster

Tools for describing and booting a Cluster.

## Marmot

https://github.com/wongfei2009/harmonylite is the new Marmot

Also has nats cluster setup.

## Registry

https://github.com/eddieraa/registry

So that each PB project is well known, via NATS.

This will allow  PB Projects to be able to call into other PB Projects.

Since we use Marmot anyways, this will be automatic.
