# git

Git and git udiffs are the bases of any system that allows to rewrite itself.


We need a golang git server and cli.

We also need ssh cli and server

## https://github.com/go-git/cli  

cli

- go install github.com/go-git/cli/cmd/gogit@latest

server

- go install github.com/go-git/cli/cmd/gogit-http-server@latest

works

## ssh in

"github.com/charmbracelet/ssh" & "github.com/charmbracelet/wish"
