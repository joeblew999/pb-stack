# datastar


A HTMX web system that uses SSE for real time Web GUI.

It can run an embedded NATS, so that you can send and review with nats KV, for example.

This makes it self autonomous, in that the NATS Leaf Server can store anything we want and run offline and then catchup when the network resolves.
