# DataStar WASM WebWorkers

**Late-bound WASM loading with DataStar and Web Workers**

## 🎯 **What This Project Does**

This project enables **late-loaded, late-bound WASM modules** (coded in Go) to run in browsers with **DataStar reactive UI** using **Web Workers** for optimal performance.

### **Key Features**
- ✅ **Late-bound WASM loading** - Load WASM modules dynamically at runtime
- ✅ **DataStar integration** - Reactive UI updates from WASM workers
- ✅ **Web Worker architecture** - Non-blocking background processing
- ✅ **Go-based WASM** - Write WASM modules in Go with full type safety
- ✅ **Professional APIs** - Production-ready worker management

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

```
DataStar UI ↔ go-wasmww Controller ↔ Late-Loaded WASM Workers

Reactive UI      Worker Management      Go Business Logic
```

## 🔧 **Built With**

- **[go-wasmww](https://github.com/magodo/go-wasmww)** - WASM Web Worker abstraction
- **[go-webworkers](https://github.com/magodo/go-webworkers)** - Base Web Worker library
- **[DataStar](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar)** - Reactive web framework

## 📁 **Components**

- **`cmd/wasm-hello/`** - Hello World WASM worker example
- **`cmd/wasm-controller/`** - go-wasmww controller for worker management

## 🚀 **Examples**

### **Basic Usage**
```go
// WASM Worker (cmd/wasm-hello/main.go)
func main() {
    self, _ := wasmww.NewSelfConn()
    ch, _ := self.SetupConn()
    
    for event := range ch {
        handleMessage(self, event)
    }
}
```

### **Controller Integration**
```go
// Controller (cmd/wasm-controller/main.go)
conn := &wasmww.WasmWebWorkerConn{
    Name: "hello-worker",
    Path: "hello-worker.wasm",
}
conn.Start()
```

## 🛣️ **Roadmap**

### **Potential Applications**

https://github.com/ajstarks/deck and its https://github.com/ajstarks/deck/tree/master/cmd can compile to wasm, and so can run in the Browser and on the Server.


- **[DeckSh](https://github.com/ajstarks/decksh)** integration - The 3 commands at [decksh/cmd](https://github.com/ajstarks/decksh/tree/master/cmd) could run as WASM in browsers with DataStar GUI updates
- **Collaborative presentation tools** with real-time updates
- **Data visualization** with background processing
- **Document processing** with reactive UI feedback

### **Future Enhancements**
- Multiple worker types (todo, SSE, validation)
- Advanced DataStar integration patterns
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Cross-worker communication protocols

## 🌟 **Why This Approach?**

1. **🚀 Performance** - Web Workers prevent UI blocking
2. **🔧 Flexibility** - Late-bound loading enables dynamic functionality
3. **💪 Type Safety** - Go WASM provides robust business logic
4. **⚡ Reactivity** - DataStar ensures responsive UI updates
5. **🏗️ Scalability** - Worker architecture scales to complex applications

**Perfect for building sophisticated web applications that need the power of Go with the responsiveness of modern web UIs!** 🌟
