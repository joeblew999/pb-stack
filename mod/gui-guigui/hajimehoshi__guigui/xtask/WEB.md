# web

The main way that users interact with the system.

We use DataStar for the web interface. https://github.com/starfederation/datastar

For Components we use https://github.com/CoreyCole/datastarui, which uses templ for Templating. 

Demo at: https://datastar-ui.com

## WASM in the Browser 

https://github.com/wanixdev/wanix.sh and https://github.com/tractordev/toolkit-go

Allow running WASM in the Browser, so that we can have golang running in the browser ( running Decksh etc ), so we can do rendering from this layer, and so have an optimistic rendering pipeline. 

https://github.com/cookiengineer/gooey is also interesting.

Testing using https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go ?
