We have taskfiles that do the same things a DEV, AI and a realtime production systems needs.

the JSON structure seems to work with task files, which is nice as we can then use JSON to drive it.

---

done:

in task files, when using a VAR, namespace it to the Taskfile name. So GH_CONFIG_FILE, etc . Otherwise you will get clashes and also confused. 

--

done:

task.taskfile.yml 

- Might call it base.taskfile.yml ? 
- should have our common dot folders ? should not be in the root Taskfile. 


---

DOING:

Group all helper task files into a dev.taskfile.yml ? This will allow us to also have a common place higher up in the file system, and then for all projects we work on, to automatically use the dev.taskfile.yml.

each specialsied task file still exists. but they are included in the dev.taskfile.

later, Projects will not even need a task file, and will then just work off JSON config, like the one for Git.

git 

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5


maybe we need https://github.com/go-git ? 
It seems to be cross platform too.

Teach it DataStar and see if it can have the same code on backend and as wasm in a browser that has a service worker.  Then we can built systems that edit data in the browser to be optimistic, sending the mutations to the backend, where the edit will be send to all other browsers. 

The files being editing in the browser can be held in memory. They are JSON or XML.

https://github.com/sst/opencode might help ?

https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud for a base File system. Does it have anything to help me use it with task and and MCP. looking for ability to see when files change, get a diff of it, and ability to sync the file. SSE and NATS help here.

All projects can then use this, and so we have a cloud capable file system.
It can also run on laptops and severs, using NATS for sync etc to the cloud versions.

NATS Jetstream and NATS AUTH

https://github.com/coro-sh/coro so that all our stuff controlled with NATS can have auth and authorisation so we have a multi tenant nats system that everything can use.
