# aqua

Its a decent way to package binaries and pull them.

I just need to integrate Task to be able to work with aqua, so i can reuse the aqua registry etc.

1. Parse

2. Upload.

3. Download.

Mise uses it.

- This looks like a good way to integrate task and aqua.

- All i need to do is parse the aqua registry system. EX: https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry/blob/main/pkgs/hashicorp/terraform/registry.yaml
