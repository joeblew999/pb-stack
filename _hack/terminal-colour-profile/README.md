# colorprofile

```sh

go run .

Your color profile is what we call 'TrueColor'.

You know, your colors are quite fancy.

A cute color we like is: #6b50ff.

This terminal needs that color to be a color.RGBA, at best.
In this case that color is #6b50ff.

Apple Terminal would want this color to be: 63 (an ansi.ExtendedColor).

This terminal: Cute puppy!!
4-bit ANSI: Cute puppy!!
Old school cool: Cute puppy!!
No TTY :( Cute puppy!!
```
